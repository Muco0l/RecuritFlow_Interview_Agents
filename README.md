# RecruitFlow-Agents

This repository contains the backend AI agents for **RecruitFlow-Interviews** ‚Äî a live, intelligent interview simulation platform designed to replicate realistic interview experiences using real-time WebRTC and LLM-driven agents.

---

## üß† Overview

RecruitFlow-Agents is the AI core behind the interview experience. It consists of multiple intelligent agents built using LangChain and LLM APIs (Gemini 2.0 Flash + GPT-4o), which simulate:

- Resume parsing
- Job description understanding
- Dynamic question generation
- Live audio conversation with the candidate

##üîó WebRTC Connection Flow (LiveKit Cloud)
Frontend initializes a new interview session via LiveKit API.

It shares room credentials (Room name, Token) with the backend via API or WebSocket.

The backend joins the same LiveKit room as a "virtual interviewer".

Backend listens to candidate's audio, streams responses via GPT-4o, and sends back audio in real-time.


#Connecting To the Client

**The Client side Frontend connects to this agent via WebRTC connection i.e. with LiveKit Cloud**
